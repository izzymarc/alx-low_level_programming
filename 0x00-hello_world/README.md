ALX C Programming Project: 0x00. C - Hello, World

Introduction:
This project is the initial step in the ALX Africa curriculum for C programming, focusing on fundamental aspects such as compilation and basic C code execution.

Task 0: Preprocessing Magic
File: 0-preprocessor

Input: gcc -E $CFILE -o c
Task 1: Compilation Chronicles
File: 1-compiler
A script that compiles a C file without linking.
Input: gcc -c $CFILE
Task 2: Assembly Adventures
File: 2-assembler
A script that generates the assembly code of a C file, saving it in an output file.
Input: gcc $CFILE -S
Task 3: Name Matters
File: 3-name
A script that compiles a C file, creating an executable named cisfun.
Input: gcc $CFILE -o cisfun
Task 4: The Art of puts
File: 4-puts.c
A C program printing "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a new line.

A C program printing "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line.
Task 6: Size Matters
File: 6-size.c
A C program displaying the size of various types on the compiling and running computer.
Bonus Task 1: Assembly Illumination
File: 100-intel
A script generating the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file, saving it in an output file.
Bonus Task 2: Artistic Wisdom
