PROJECT 0x02: C - Functions, Nested Loops
image

Introduction
In Project 0x02, we delve into the world of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. Nested loops, aptly named "loop inside loop," involve placing one loop statement within another. The header file, main.h, plays a crucial role as it contains prototypes for all functions, including the essential _putchar function.

File Overview
main.h: This header file is the linchpin, housing prototypes for all functions used in the project.

0-putchar.c: A program that prints -putchar, followed by a new line.

1-alphabet.c: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

2-print_alphabet_x10.c: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, each followed by a new line.

3-islower.c: A function that checks for a lowercase character.

4-isalpha.c: A function that checks for an alphabetic character.

5-sign.c: A function that prints the sign of a number.

6-abs.c: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

7-print_last_digit.c: A function that prints the last digit of a number.

8-24_hours.c: A function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, from 00:00 to 23:59.

10-add.c: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11-print_to_98.c: A function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

_putchar.c: Contains the _putchar() function definition.

Advanced Task
100-times_table.c: A function that prints the n times table, starting from 0.

101-natural.c: A program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluding 1024), followed by a new line.

102-fibonacci.c: A program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

103-fibonacci.c: A program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence under 4000000, followed by a new line.

104-fibonacci.c: A program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
