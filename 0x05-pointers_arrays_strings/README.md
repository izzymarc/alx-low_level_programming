## Introduction

This project explores the concept of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. In C, pointers are essential for various operations, including dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of data structures.

## Files

Here's an overview of the files in this project:

- `main.h`: This is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

- `0-reset_to_98.c`: This file contains a function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98.

- `1-swap.c`: This file contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.

- `2-strlen.c`: This file contains a function that calculates the length of a string.

- `3-puts.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to the standard output.

- `4-print_rev.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

- `5-rev_string.c`: This file contains a function that reverses a string.

- `6-puts2.c`: This file contains a function that prints every other character of a string, followed by a new line.

- `7-puts_half.c`: This file contains a function that prints the second half of a string, followed by a new line.

- `8-print_array.c`: This file contains a function that prints a specified number of elements from an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- `9-strcpy.c`: This file contains a function that copies a source string (including the null terminator) to a destination buffer.

- `100-atoi.c`: This file contains a function that converts a string to an integer.

- `101-keygen.c`: This is a program that generates random valid passwords for a program called `101-crackme`.

- `_putchar.c`: This file contains the definition of the `_putchar()` function used for printing characters to the standard output.
