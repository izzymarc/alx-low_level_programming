0-strcat.c: A function that joins two strings together (concatenation).
1-strncat.c: A function that concatenates two strings using a maximum of n bytes from the src string.
2-strncpy.c: A function designed to copy one string into another.
3-strcmp.c: A function for comparing the contents of two strings.
4-rev_array.c: A function that reverses the contents of an array filled with integers.
5-string_toupper.c: A function to convert every lowercase letter in a string to its uppercase counterpart.
6-cap_string.c: A function that turns the first letter of every word in a string to uppercase.
7-leet.c: A fun function that translates a string into "leet speak" or 1337.
100-rot13.c: A function that transforms a string using the ROT13 encoding.
_putchar.c: A custom function serving as a replacement for the standard library's putchar().
main.h: The header file associated with this project, which contains all necessary prototypes for our functions.
