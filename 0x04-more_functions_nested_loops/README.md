![project_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105258746/190835047-aa8ab3e3-4e8a-4302-a215-8af869289b9e.png)

#### Understanding Nested Loops

`(A nested loop is a loop inside the body of another loop)`

- **Header File:** `main.h`
  - The `main.h` file serves as the header file containing prototypes for all functions used in this project.

```
main.h file is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
```

- **Files:**
  1. `0-isupper.c`: Function to check for an uppercase character.
  2. `1-isdigit.c`: Function to check for a digit (0 through 9).
  3. `2-mul.c`: Function to multiply two integers.
  4. `3-print_numbers.c`: Function to print numbers from 0 to 9 followed by a new line.
  5. `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Function to print numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4) followed by a new line.
  6. `5-more_numbers.c`: Function to print numbers from 0 to 14, repeated 10 times, followed by a new line.
  7. `6-print_line.c`: Function to draw a straight line in the terminal.
  8. `7-print_diagonal.c`: Function to draw a diagonal line in the terminal.
  9. `8-print_square.c`: Function to print a square followed by a new line.
  10. `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Program to print numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz."
  11. `10-print_triangle.c`: Function to print a triangle followed by a new line.
  12. `100-prime_factor.c`: Program to find and print the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
  13. `101-print_number.c`: Function to print an integer using only the `_putchar()` function.
  14. `_putchar.c`: Definition of the `_putchar()` function.
